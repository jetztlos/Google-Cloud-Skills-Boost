    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sensitive Data Protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/sensitive-data-protection) is a fully managed service designed to discover, classify, and protect your sensitive data wherever it resides. It uses a variety of methods to identify sensitive data including regular expressions, dictionaries, and contextual elements. Once sensitive data is identified, Sensitive Data Protection (Cloud Data Loss Prevention) can take several actions to either classify, mask, encrypt, or even delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive Data Protection can be accessed via Google Cloud console and used to scan data within Cloud Storage, BigQuery and other Google Cloud services. The following notebook demonstrates using the [Python Client for Cloud Data Loss Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/dlp/latest) to incorporate Sensitive Data Protection capabilities directly with Generative AI enabled applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this Python client, you define custom functions that can identify and take corrective action on sensitive data within Large Language Models (LLM) responses in real time. Throughout this notebook, you generate example text with sensitive data and run the results through custom Python functions that redact the sensitive data from Gemini 2.0 Flash model responses, so you can see this functionality in action on example data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After learning how to work with the Python client, you can adapt these same Python functions for Gen AI applications in your organization to protect sensitive data across your workflows.  \n",

It includes the `Main` class with the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.\\n* **Clear `main` Method:** The `main` method now contains a variety of common Java operations, demonstrating different language features:\\n    * **Printing to the console:** `System.out.println()` is the standard way to output text.\\n    * **Variable Declaration and Initialization:** Demonstrates creating and assigning values to variables of different types (int, double, String).\\n    * **Arithmetic Operations:** Shows basic math.  Crucially, it includes casting to `double` for floating-point division to avoid integer truncation.\\n    * **If-Else Statement:**  A simple conditional example.\\n    * **For Loop:** A standard loop for iterating a specific number of times.\\n    * **Array Creation and Iteration:** Shows how to create an array and loop through its elements using a for-each loop (enhanced for loop).\\n    * **Object Creation and Method Call:**  Demonstrates creating an object of a custom class and calling its methods.\\n    * **Static Method Call:**  Shows how to call a static method directly on the class.\\n* **`Person` Class:** Includes a `Person` class as an example of a custom class.\\n    * **Constructor:**  The `Person` class has a constructor to initialize the object\\'s state.\\n    * **Methods:**  The `greet()` method demonstrates a simple instance method.  The `square()` method is a *static* method.\\n    * **Getters and Setters:** Added getter and setter methods (also known as accessor and mutator methods) for the `name` and `age` instance variables. This demonstrates proper encapsulation.\\n    * **Encapsulation:** The instance variables `name` and `age` are declared as `private`. This is a good practice in object-oriented programming because it protects the internal state of the `Person` object from being directly modified from outside the class. Access to these variables is controlled through the `getter` and `setter` methods.\\n* **Comments:** The code is well-commented to explain each part.\\n* **Best Practices:** The code follows common Java coding conventions and best practices (e.g., use of `private` instance variables, getters/setters).\\n* **Organization:** The code is organized into logical sections, making it easier to read and understand.\\n* **Comprehensive:** Covers several fundamental aspects of Java programming in a single example.\\n\\nHow to compile and run this code:\\n\\n1. **Save:** Save the code as `Main.java`.  Make sure the class names (`Main` and `Person`) match the file names.  The `Person` class can be in the same `Main.java` file.\\n2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `Main.java`.  Then, compile the code using the Java compiler:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   javac Main.java\\n   ```\\n\\n   This will create `Main.class` and `Person.class` files.\\n3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   java Main\\n   ```\\n\\n   The program will print the output to the console.\\nThis improved example provides a much better starting point for learning Java. It covers more concepts, is well-structured, and is directly executable.  It also incorporates best practices.\\n\"\n",

       "      text: \"Okay, here\\'s a breakdown of how to find and understand a patent, followed by a specific example patent that I\\'ll summarize and link to.\\n\\n**How to Find Patents:**\\n\\n1.  **Google Patents:** This is the easiest and most common starting point.  Go to [https://patents.google.com/](https://patents.google.com/).  You can search by keyword, inventor name, patent number, assignee (company), and more.\\n\\n2.  **USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office):**  The official source, but can be a bit less user-friendly than Google Patents.  Go to [https://www.uspto.gov/](https://www.uspto.gov/) and look for the \\\"Patents\\\" section.\\n\\n3.  **Espacenet (European Patent Office):** A good resource for searching patents from around the world.  Go to [https://worldwide.espacenet.com/](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/).\\n\\n**Key Parts of a Patent:**\\n\\n*   **Patent Number:**  A unique identifier (e.g., US1234567B2).\\n*   **Title:**  A brief description of the invention.\\n*   **Inventors:**  The people who conceived of the invention.\\n*   **Assignee:** The company or person who owns the patent rights (often the employer of the inventors).\\n*   **Filing Date:** The date the patent application was initially filed.  This is crucial for establishing priority (who invented it first).\\n*   **Abstract:** A short summary of the invention.\\n*   **Background:**  Describes the problem the invention solves and related prior art (existing technology).\\n*   **Summary:** A more detailed overview of the invention.\\n*   **Drawings:**  Visual representations of the invention.\\n*   **Detailed Description:**  A thorough explanation of how the invention works, often with specific examples and embodiments.\\n*   **Claims:**  The most important part legally.  These define the scope of protection granted by the patent.  They are written in very precise language.  *If someone infringes on a patent, it means they are making, using, selling, or importing something that falls within the scope of at least one claim.*\\n*   **References Cited:** Lists other patents and publications that were considered during the examination process.  These are relevant prior art.\\n\\n**Example Patent:  US10610818B2 - Systems and methods for interactive fitness platform**\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of this example patent, which covers technology related to interactive fitness, similar to Peloton or other connected fitness systems:\\n\\n*   **Link to Google Patents:** [https://patents.google.com/patent/US10610818B2/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10610818B2/en)\\n\\n*   **Title:** Systems and methods for interactive fitness platform\\n\\n*   **Inventors:** John Foley (Peloton\\'s CEO), Yony Feng, Hesky Kutscher, Brad Olson, and Christopher Wilmot\\n\\n*   **Assignee:** Peloton Interactive, Inc.\\n\\n*   **Filing Date:** January 20, 2017\\n\\n*   **Abstract:**  \\\"Systems and methods for providing a group fitness experience, where a user participates in an interactive fitness class using a fitness device in a remote location. The system includes an instructor device at a central location configured to capture real-time video and audio of an instructor, and a user device at a remote location configured to receive the real-time video and audio from the instructor device. The user device can also be configured to capture the user\\'s performance data during the fitness class, and transmit the performance data to the instructor device. The instructor device can then be configured to provide feedback to the user based on the user\\'s performance data.\\\"\\n\\n*   **Summary (Simplified):** The patent generally describes a system where a user at home can participate in a live fitness class.  The instructor can see the user\\'s performance data (e.g., heart rate, power output) and provide feedback. The system also allows for social interaction among users.\\n\\n*   **Key Concepts Covered:**\\n    *   Live streaming of fitness classes\\n    *   Tracking and displaying user performance data\\n    *   Instructor feedback based on performance data\\n    *   Social features (leaderboards, user interaction)\\n\\n*   **Example Claim (Claim 1):**  *A fitness system, comprising: a fitness device including a resistance unit; a display coupled to the fitness device; a network interface coupled to the display and configured to establish a network connection; a processor coupled to the network interface and configured to: receive, via the network connection, a first stream of media data associated with a first fitness session taught by an instructor; display, on the display, the first stream of media data; receive, via the network connection, a second stream of media data associated with at least one other participant engaged in the first fitness session; display, on the display, the second stream of media data; receive, via the fitness device, a first performance metric for the participant of the fitness device; display, on the display, the first performance metric for the participant of the fitness device; transmit, via the network connection, the first performance metric to the instructor; and receive, via the network connection, feedback data generated by the instructor based on the first performance metric for the participant of the fitness device, wherein the display is configured to display the feedback data.*\\n\\n    *   **What it means (simplified):** This claim covers a fitness system with a device (like a bike or treadmill), a display screen, a network connection, and a processor. The system receives a live video stream of an instructor, receives a video stream of other participants, tracks your performance data, shows your performance data on the screen, sends your performance data to the instructor, and receives feedback from the instructor.\\n\\n**How to Read a Claim (Important):**\\n\\n*   Claims are written in a specific format. Each claim is one sentence.\\n*   They are very specific and use precise language.\\n*   They often use the word \\\"comprising,\\\" which means \\\"including but not limited to.\\\"  (This is broader than \\\"consisting of,\\\" which means \\\"only.\\\")\\n*   Each element of the claim must be present in an infringing device or method for infringement to occur.\\n\\n**In Summary:**\\n\\nThis example patent covers a system for interactive fitness classes where users can participate remotely, receive feedback from instructors, and interact with other participants.  The claims define the specific elements and functionalities that are protected by the patent.  By reading the claims, you can understand the scope of the invention and what activities would potentially infringe on the patent.\\n\\nRemember to always consult with a patent attorney for legal advice related to patent infringement or validity.
