    "[Grounding in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini) lets you use generative text models to generate content grounded in your own documents and data. This capability lets the model access information at runtime that goes beyond its training data. By grounding model responses in Google Search results or data stores within [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction), LLMs that are grounded in data can produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces model hallucinations (instances where the model generates content that isn't factual)\n",
    "- Anchors model responses to specific information, documents, and data sources\n",
    "- Enhances the trustworthiness, accuracy, and applicability of the generated content\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure two different sources of grounding in Vertex AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Google Search results for data that is publicly available and indexed.\n",
    "   - If you use this service in a production application, you will also need to [use a Google Search entry point](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/grounding-search-entry-points).\n",
    "2. [Data stores in Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest), which can include your own data in the form of website data, unstructured data, or structured data"

       "*   **Automatic Data Splitting**: Automatically split data into training, test, and validation sets\n",
       "*   **Data Exploration:** Managed datasets allow you to generate data statistics and visualizations to quickly inspect data distributions and identify missing values.\n",
       "*   **Model Governance:** They enable tracking of lineage to models for governance and iterative development.\n",
       "*   **Performance Comparison**: Managed datasets allow comparing model performance by training AutoML and custom models using the same datasets.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Supported Data Types:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Vertex AI managed datasets support various data types, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Tabular Datasets:** Consist of structured data in rows and columns, typically in CSV or JSON format.\n",
       "*   **Image Datasets:** Contain images for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n",

       "Booking business travel involves a few key steps, and the best approach often depends on the size of your company and the frequency of travel. Here's a general guide:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Determine Your Company's Travel Policy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Does your company have a preferred booking method?** Many companies use specific online booking tools or travel management companies.\n",
       "*   **Are there pre-approved hotels or airlines?** Travel policies often include preferred vendors to leverage negotiated rates or loyalty programs.\n",
       "*   **What is the approval process?** Understand if you need to get approval from a manager before booking.\n",
       "*   **What are the spending limits?** Policies usually outline acceptable price ranges for flights, hotels, and other expenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Choose a Booking Method:**\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "*   **Online Travel Agencies (OTAs):** Websites like Expedia, Kayak, and Booking.com can be convenient for comparing prices and options. However, they may not always offer the best deals for business travelers, and you might miss out on corporate discounts or benefits.\n",
       "*   **Directly with Airlines and Hotels:** Booking directly can sometimes give you access to better rates, especially if you're a loyalty program member.\n",
       "*   **Travel Management Companies (TMCs):** TMCs (like American Express Global Business Travel, BCD Travel, or CWT) specialize in corporate travel. They offer a range of services, including booking flights and hotels, managing travel itineraries, and providing 24/7 support. They can also help you track travel expenses and ensure compliance with your company's travel policy.\n",
       "*   **Dedicated Business Travel Booking Platforms:** Several platforms cater specifically to business travel, such as Navan (formerly TripActions), TravelPerk, and Spotnana. These platforms often integrate with expense management systems and offer features like travel policy enforcement, automated reporting, and duty of care support.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Search and Compare Options:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Flights:** Look for flights that fit your schedule and budget. Consider factors like layovers, baggage fees, and seat selection.\n",
       "*   **Hotels:** Choose hotels that are conveniently located and offer the amenities you need (e.g., Wi-Fi, business center). Consider your company's preferred hotels or those that offer corporate rates.\n",
       "*   **Car Rentals/Ground Transportation:** If necessary, book a rental car or arrange for airport transfers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Book and Confirm:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Double-check all details** before confirming your booking (dates, times, names, etc.).\n",
       "*   **Save your confirmation numbers** and any relevant contact information.\n",
       "*   **Add the trip to your calendar** and share your itinerary with colleagues or family members.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Expense Reporting:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Keep track of all your expenses,** including receipts for flights, hotels, meals, and transportation.\n",
       "*   **Submit your expense report** according to your company's policy. Many travel booking platforms integrate with expense management systems to automate this process.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tips for Efficient Business Travel Booking:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Book in advance:** You'll often get better rates by booking flights and hotels well in advance of your trip.\n",
       "*   **Be flexible with your dates:** If possible, try to be flexible with your travel dates. Sometimes flying on a Tuesday or Wednesday can save you money.\n",
       "*   **Consider alternative airports:** Flying into or out of a smaller, less busy airport can sometimes be cheaper.\n",
       "*   **Use travel apps:** Download the apps for your preferred airlines, hotels, and rental car companies. These apps can provide you with real-time updates on your flights, hotel reservations, and other travel information.\n",
       "*   **Take advantage of loyalty programs:** If you travel frequently, sign up for airline, hotel, and rental car loyalty programs. You can earn points or miles that can be redeemed for free travel or other benefits.\n"

       "\n",
       "**3. Refining Your Search and Comparison Strategies:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Flights:**\n",
       "    *   *Optimal Booking Window:* Generally, 2-3 weeks in advance for domestic and 1-3 months for international travel can yield the best prices (but this varies greatly depending on route, season, and demand).\n",
       "    *   *Use Flight Comparison Tools:* Google Flights, Kayak, and Skyscanner are useful for identifying the cheapest days to fly and alternative airports.\n",

       "    *   *Watch out for Basic Economy:* Basic Economy fares often restrict seat selection, baggage allowance, and changes. Make sure it aligns with your needs.\n",
       "*   **Hotels:**\n",
       "    *   *Location, Location, Location:* Choose hotels near your meeting location or with easy access to transportation.\n",
       "    *   *Read Reviews:* Check reviews on TripAdvisor, Google Hotels, and other sites to get an idea of the hotel's quality and service.\n",
       "    *   *Negotiate Corporate Rates:* If you travel frequently to a particular city, try to negotiate a corporate rate with a hotel.\n",
       "    *   *Consider Amenities:* Does the hotel have free Wi-Fi, a business center, a gym, and free breakfast?\n",
       "*   **Car Rentals/Ground Transportation:**\n",
       "    *   *Compare Rental Companies:* Use comparison sites to find the best deals on rental cars.\n",
       "    *   *Consider Ride-Sharing:* Uber and Lyft can be convenient and cost-effective for short trips.\n",
       "    *   *Look for Airport Shuttles:* Many hotels offer free airport shuttles, which can save you money on transportation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Booking and Confirmation - The Finer Points:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Passport and Visa Requirements:** If traveling internationally, ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your return date and that you have any necessary visas.\n",
       "*   **TSA PreCheck/Global Entry:** If you travel frequently, consider applying for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry to expedite airport security.\n",
       "*   **Seat Selection:** Choose your seat in advance to ensure you get a comfortable spot.\n",
       "*   **Mobile Check-In:** Check in for your flight online or via the airline's app to save time at the airport.\n",
